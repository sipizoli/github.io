            <td style="text-align: left; color: yellow ;">Edible mushrooms are the fleshy and edible fruit bodies of several species of macrofungi (fungi which
                bear fruiting structures that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye). They can appear either
                below ground (hypogeous) or above ground (epigeous) where they may be picked by hand.[2] Edibility may
                be defined by criteria that include absence of poisonous effects on humans and desirable taste and
                aroma.[3]

                Edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional and culinary value. Mushrooms, especially dried
                shiitake, are sources of umami flavor from guanylate.[4] Mushrooms consumed by those practicing folk
                medicine are known as medicinal mushrooms. While psychedelic mushrooms are occasionally consumed for
                recreational or entheogenic purposes, they can produce psychological effects, and are therefore not
                commonly used as food.[5] There is no evidence from high-quality clinical research that 'medicinal'
                mushrooms have any effect on human diseases.

                Edible mushrooms include many fungal species that are either harvested wild or cultivated. Easily
                cultivated and common wild mushrooms are often available in markets, and those that are more difficult
                to obtain (such as the prized truffle, matsutake and morel) may be collected on a smaller scale by
                private gatherers. Some preparations may render certain poisonous mushrooms fit for consumption.

                Before assuming that any wild mushroom is edible, it should be identified. Accurate determination and
                proper identification of a species is the only safe way to ensure edibility, and the only safeguard
                against possible accident. Some mushrooms that are edible for most people can cause allergic reactions
                in some individuals, and old or improperly stored specimens can cause food poisoning. Great care should
                therefore be taken when eating any fungus for the first time, and only small quantities should be
                consumed in case of individual allergies. Deadly poisonous mushrooms that are frequently confused with
                edible mushrooms and responsible for many fatal poisonings include several species of the genus Amanita,
                in particular, Amanita phalloides, the death cap. It is therefore better to eat only a few, easily
                recognizable species, than to experiment indiscriminately. Moreover, even normally edible species of
                mushrooms may be dangerous, as mushrooms growing in polluted locations can accumulate pollutants such as
                heavy metals.[6]

        Toxic mushrooms
        Main article: Mushroom poisoning

        Young Amanita phalloides "death cap" mushrooms, with a matchbox for size comparison
        Many mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or
        bioluminescent. Although there are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly
        severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the
        mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently
        distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals
        that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see emetics), or to learn to
        avoid consumption altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb heavy metals, including
        those that are radioactive, European mushrooms may, as late as 2008, include toxicity from the 1986 Chernobyl
        disaster and continue to be studied.[30][31]
